In this paper, we present an automatic colorization model for gray scale images based on a generative adversarial networks (GAN). The proposed model is composed of U-Net structure generator and a discriminator with multi-layer convolutional neural network. Then the loss function and weights of true reliability value in the discriminator are optimized. Finally, the corresponding constructed gray scale images colored and colored images are used for training to get an automatic coloring model. In experiments section, we provide various visualization results to validate the effectiveness of our method. The result of a large number of gray scale images coloring experiments show that the model has good learning ability on color transfer and can achieve better coloring effects.
