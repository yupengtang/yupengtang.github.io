Research Experience
======
* **Image Colorization using Generative Adversarial Network** (Sep. 2021 – April. 2022)  
  *	Proposed an automatic colorization model for grayscale images based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) composed of a U-Net structure generator and a discriminator with multi-layer CNN.
  *	Constructed a deep generator network to extract the content features of the image, optimized the loss function and weights of actual reliability value in the discriminator and trained the model with grayscale images and colored images to obtain the automatic coloring model.
  *	Validated the modeling results through extensive grayscale images coloring experiment to demonstrate this model’s excellent learning ability on color transfer, coloring effects, efficiency, and accuracy.
