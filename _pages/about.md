I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, specializing in Machine Learning and Visual Analytics. This path follows my Bachelor’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from Shandong University, where I developed a deep passion for using technology to solve real-world problems. My academic journey has not only strengthened my technical foundation but also sparked a genuine excitement for creating solutions that make an impact.

Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in languages like Python, C/C++, and SQL, and worked extensively with tools such as AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes. Whether it’s building distributed systems or working on full-stack development, I’ve always been drawn to projects that challenge me to think critically and innovate. I thrive in environments where I can apply data-driven approaches to tackle complex, large-scale challenges.

I’m eager to continue this journey and contribute to teams that are shaping the future of technology. I’m actively seeking roles in Software Development, Data Science, Data Engineering, or Machine Learning Engineering, where I can channel my passion and expertise into creating efficient, scalable, and impactful solutions. I truly believe that technology, when applied thoughtfully, can drive change—and I’m excited to be part of that movement.
